   ###### This example illustrates conversion of Human Speech into Text using Google API. [[Source Code]](https://github.com/rahulvaish/SpeechToText_TextToSpeech-Python/tree/SpeechToText)
   * On Anaconda Shell - pip install SpeechRecognition
   * On Anaconda Shell - pip install PyAudio
   ###### To Convert Speaking Speech into Text:
   * Code the below Snippet-

   * Execute the above program. Now, whatever you say on the microphone, gets converted into text :)   
   * **POINT TO NOTE:** The above code snippet works with the default language is English. If we speak in any other language example Hindi, the text is interpreted in the form of English, like as below-
